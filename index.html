            <h2><u>Cloud Computing Revolution</u></h2>
            <p>Cloud technology has enabled companies to scale their infrastructure rapidly. With platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, businesses are leveraging the power of the cloud for greater flexibility and reduced operational costs.</p>

            <p>The next breakthrough came in 2003, when Amazon released Amazon Web Services (AWS) internally. AWS was a shared infrastructure service that developers could use without having to reinvent the wheel for every project, each time (each project was building its own database and storage components, when these could easily be shared by all).</p>

            <h2><u>Data Privacy and Security Concerns</u></h2>
            <p>As data becomes the most valuable asset for companies, concerns about data privacy and security have surged. The increasing number of cyberattacks and data breaches is pushing governments to enforce stricter data protection laws.</p>

            <p>With today’s plethora of cybersecurity approaches, some would argue that data security does not merit being treated as a separate discipline. Today’s integrated email security solutions, for example, may include measures that detect and block attempts to send sensitive data via the SMTP protocol.</p>
